This plugin will help you register new post types and taxonomies.


== Description ==

This is a simple plugin that will help you register new Post Types and new Taxonomies.

No ads. 

Registering a new Post Type you will have to fill a new name, if you want - you can change the slug or insert a description, select what type of post type you want: public or private. For additional options you can add via hooks.

Registering a new Taxonomy - insert the name ( note: a lot of names are reserved ), change the slug if needed or add a description, select what post type to apply this taxonomy and if you want it to be private or public. Other options you can add via hooks.

I made this plugin with less options because I like to add new post types and taxonomies with basic options.

In the future I plan to add additional features.
